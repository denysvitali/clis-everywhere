# Examples of CLIs

```bash
$ id
```

```
uid=1000(dvitali) gid=1000(dvitali) groups=1000(dvitali),970(docker),998(wheel)
```

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
```

```bash
$ curl -s "https://pizza.k8s.best/api/v1/pizzas" | jq .
```
```json
{
  "pizzas": [
    {
        "name": "Pizza Prosciutto",
        "toppings": ["tomato", "mozzarella", "ham"]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Why do we need more CLIs?

- Machine readable / processable outputs

- Command concatenation (piping) `|`

- Scripting (e.g: via `bash`)

- To follow the [Unix Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Eric_Raymond's_17_Unix_Rules)
    - "Write simple programs"
    - "Write small programs"
    - "Value developer time over machine time"
    - "Avoid unnecessary output"

# Ordering burritos from my SPARC (1992)

Excerpt from the original email

```
Subject: Ordering burritos from my SPARC
From: cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com (Curtis Jackson)
To: tanstaafl@colossus.apple.com
Date: Tue, 08 Sep 92 09:12:20 PDT

There is a little Mexican grocery nearby that has an assembly-line
burrito operation in back. You walk down the line with the person
who is making your burrito, telling them exactly what you want on it.
The problem is that the place is so good and such a good value that
the lines get quite long at times. So La Costena (that's a tilde n)
put in a fax machine and allows you to fax in your orders. Well, we've
gone a quantum leap beyond that with the following.

This is NOT a joke. Ross has taken advantage of the fact that some
PostScript Level 2 printers now have fax capability. Read the whole
doc below when you get a chance -- it represents true burrito decadence!

# Ordering burritos from my SPARC (1992)

```
Tired of standing in line at La Costena?  This file documents an
automatic facility for sending a fax to La Costena that orders 1 or
more burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and whatever.  The command will
compose the fax, and send it to your favorite PostScript fax printer,
for direct transmission to La Costena, and no paper at this end will
be generated.  Then, when you get there, your food will be waiting.
No worries.

To use this, you will want to add the following lines to your .cshrc
file:

setenv BURRITOPRINTER = <printer>
alias burrito /user/thompson/public/burrito<mach>

<printer> should be the name of a PostScript level 2 printer that
supports fax and is connected to an external phone line. I use

In keeping with long standing Unix tradition, the syntax for
specifying burritos is somewhat obscure. Here is an attempt at
explanation, with some examples at the end.  For a better
understanding, the energetic reader will attempt to thoroughly
comprehend the contents of my .costenarc file.
```

# Ordering burritos from my SPARC (1992)

```
burrito [-n "name"] [-t <time>] [-p phone#] [-d] [-x] [FoodSpec [...]]

    -n  specify the name at the top of the order blank.
	   This should be the name of the person who will pick
	   up the order.  Default is current user, as defined in
	   /etc/passwd.
    -t  specify the time at which you will pick up the order.
    	   time may be absolute 24 hour time or +delta. Default is +1:00.
    -p  specify callback number in case La Costena has questions.
	   default is as found in /usr/local/adobe/phones/adobe.phones.
```

# Ordering burritos from my SPARC (1992)

```
Up to six FoodSpecs can be specified:
FoodSpec::=<type>[options*][/<name>]
<type> ::= [b|t|m|q|T]
    (burrito, taco, mexico city, quesadilla, Taqitaco)
options:
    +g  gucamole
    +c  cheddar
    +cc cotija
    +cl cilantro
    +cm monterey
    +i"note" special instructions (e.g. black beans, no rice, etc.)
	NOTE: the "s need to be escaped if the shell sees them:
	   +i\"note\"
    +j  whole jalepenos
    +jf fresh jalapenos
    +js sliced jalapenos
    +n:i i copies of this food item. (default = 1)
    +o  olives
    +s  medium salsa
    +sc sour cream
    +sf fire salsa
    +sh hot salsa

burrito -time +:30 b+g+cc+jf+jf+sf+sc-sc+i"Black Beans"+n:2/Ross \
   b+v:cc+g+cm+sc+i"no rice"/Kathie

interpretation:
logged in user will pick up an order in 30 minutes.
  Ross wants two rice and bean (default) burritos with
    guacamole
    cotija
    fresh jalepenos (double)
    fire salsa
    no sour cream (cancelled)
    Black beans (comment)
  Kathie wants a Chile Colorado burrito with
    guacamole
    montery cheese
    sour cream
    no rice (comment)

# Result


- The burrito order only needs textual input

- The process can be extended

- You can now order burritos automatically, thanks to `cron`

```
# Order a Burrito on Monday at 11:45 AM
45 11 * * 1 burrito -time +:30 b+g+cc+jf+jf+sf+sc-sc+n:2/Denys

Let's assume for a second that you're like me:

- You receive lots of mail (postal mail, yes.)

- You mostly care about invoices

- You like to build CLIs

- You have a scanner at home

Optical character recognition

A process called Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) converts printed texts into digital image files. It
is a digital copier that uses automation to convert
scanned documents into editable, shareable PDFs that
are machine-readable. OCR may be seen in action
when you use your computer to scan a receipt. The
scan is then saved as a picture on your computer. The
words in the image cannot be searched, edited, or Farly ‚Äî√úZZ√ÑI‚Äú‚Äú""_‚Äú e i

counted, but you may use OCR to convert the image A e T 0230
to a text document with the content stored as text.
OCR software can extract data from scanned
documents, camera photos, and image-only PDFs. It
makes static material editable and does away with the

necessity for human data entry.[!]

time optical character recognition (OCR)
